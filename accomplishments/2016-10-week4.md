### Week in Review

This was my last week working from home. It was interesting and something I could get used to, but sadly not forever right now.
Other aspects were improving, so that is great news and I'm crossing my fingers still that it continues. I didn't get to 
much on the list, but still mananaged some stuff. Here's to next week!
